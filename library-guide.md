# How to add or update osquery third party libraries

## What to know before starting

This is not and won't ever be a step by step, precise guide to update a library, because it highly depends on which library has to be updated (and their build system), on which platform this is happening, what toolchain is being used and so on.

The core of the matter though is that osquery official builds strive very hard to be portable and to be compatible with a wide range of OS versions.
There's a list of things that it tries to do to achieve that:

- Properly configure the official platform toolchain so that it targets the lowest supported version of the target OS
- When the default toolchain doesn't provide a way to easily do the above (on Linux derived OSs), it provides a custom built toolchain that uses the core libraries and headers of the system, at a version used by the minimum version of OS we target.
- All the libraries used (with some exceptions depending on the OS) are linked statically.
- The project strive not to depend on any library version that is specific to a particular OS version. Using a custom built toolchain where needed is the first step, but then one has to ensure that no system libraries, from the system osquery is being compiled on, are being used
